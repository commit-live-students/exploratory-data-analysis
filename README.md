## Instructors code alongs

* [EDA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commit-live-students/exploratory-data-analysis/master/notebooks/introduction_to_machine_learning.ipynb)

### About Pima Indians Diabetes

  * [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)

## Practical Advise 
  *  EDA is not a compulsary step. Most  
  *  Its not even a step. Its what you call as getting a feel. 
  *  Have your Checklist Ready 
  *  Apply en-masse
  
## Quantitative EDA
  * Dimensions of your data - .shape
  * Statistical Summary - .describe()
  * Get General Highlevel - .info()
  * Class Distribution - .groupby('class').size()
  * Pairwise Pearson correlations - .corr()
  * Skew for each attribute - .skew()
  * Head()/ Tail()
  
## Visual EDA
  * Keep the DAMN thing clean - Don't do a half hearted job at it - Else, don't do it
  * What every chart should have?
     *  Title 
     *  xlabels
     *  ylabels
     *  xticks
     *  yticks
     *  xmin
     *  ymin
     *  legend
     *  annotate 
  *  Have a default script - 
  *  Know the following
     *  What kind of insight is best drawn from what kind of chart? Refer Taxonomy
     *  Sacrilegious mistakes - What kind of features can be plotted? Can't do a scatter plot on catgorical variables
     *  Know your variable/ feature scales - Nominal/ Ordinal/ Interval/ Ratio
  *  Most used plots
    *  Q Q Plot
    *  Scatter
    *  Line
    *  Histogram
    *  Correlogram
    *  Box & Whiskers 

## Assignments 
*  [UCI Data Repository Review](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
  *  Go to the Data Repository - Select the below 10 Datasets   
    *  [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
    *  [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
    *  [Sonar](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))
    *  [Pima Indians Diabetes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes)
    *  [Water Treatment Plant](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Water+Treatment+Plant)

  *  Make a Group of 2/3 - Download the Datasets - Read 'Data Set Description'
  *  Each team will explain the dataset and corresponding domain required to understand the day
 Â *  These are extremely popular the Datasets - You will most likely find ready made Python code for EDA - Google it and go through it
