    "\n",

    "Basic idea: sample important groups separately,\n",

    "\n",
    "Statistical bias refers to measurement or sampling errors that are systematic and pro‐\n",
    "duced by the measurement or sampling process. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important distinction should be\n",
    "made between errors due to random chance, and errors due to bias\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection bias**: some groups in population are\n",
    "over- or under-represented in sample\n",
    "(the sampling frame is limited)\n",
    "2. **Non-response bias**: non-respondents may differ\n",
    "in important ways from respondents\n",

    "3. **Response bias**: e.g., wording of questions,\n",
    "telescoping in the recall of events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling error of a statistic is the error that occurs\n",

    "will be above the parameter (positive sample error), and\n",
    "sometimes it will be below it (negative sampling error).\n",
    "* Eventually we will be able to predict/control the amount\n",
    "of sampling error (called the margin of error). \n",

    "with a larger sample size?\n",

    "* Sampling error can be broken down into two parts:\n",
    "    * Bias – the systematic error and distance of a sample\n",

    "study design (reduced by using random sampling)\n",
    "* Variability captures the spread in the sample statistic (\n",
    "reduced by increasing sample size)\n",
    "* If bias = 0 and variability is small, the values of a\n",
